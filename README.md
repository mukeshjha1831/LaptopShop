**1. Product JSON:** I have created a structured JSON file for the product "Laptop" with the following fields: name, price, picture, RAM, SDD, HDD, ScreenSize, and OS. This ensures that each laptop is represented accurately in the data source.

**Category Page:** A dedicated Category page has been developed, showcasing a comprehensive list of laptops. On the right side of the page, you will find a filter section that allows users to refine their search based on parameters such as RAM, HDD, and Price. The filter options are prominently displayed and easily accessible.

**Filter Functionality:** The filter functionality has been implemented to work seamlessly. Users can select and deselect various filter options, and the product list on the left section of the Category page dynamically updates in real-time, displaying only the laptops that match the selected filter criteria.

**Default Product Display:** By default, the Category page displays three relevant laptops on the left section. These products are carefully chosen to provide an engaging and informative initial browsing experience.

**Load More Option:** To enhance user experience, we have included a "Load More" button on the left section of the Category page. Clicking on this button loads the next set of three laptops, and users can continue loading more products until the entire catalog is accessible.
